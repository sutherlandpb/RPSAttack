Rock Paper Scissors Attack

This is a match-3 type engine, pieces can be swapped between left and right or up and down, adjacent pieces only.
Instead of matching 3 in a row, the "destroy" mechanic is triggered when an object collides with another object that is weak against it.

Paper beats Rock
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper

Non-combatant pieces are "junk" junk is destroyed by havinga block of the same color explode next to it.

Pieces at rest do not destroy other pieces, only a swap toward a weak piece can trigger destruction.
